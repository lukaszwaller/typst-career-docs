  "I am excited to apply for the Engineer position at Company GmbH. With a strong focus on Rust and cloud-native architectures, I specialize in building high-performance backend services that scale seamlessly. The chance to apply these skills to optimize large-scale fleets aligns perfectly with my passion for systems programming and real-time data processing.",
  "In my current role, I designed a Rust-based telemetry ingestion pipeline using Tokio and Actix that reliably processes tens of millions of events per day with sub-millisecond latency. By leveraging async Rust, structured logging, and Prometheus observability, I was able to reduce tail latencies by over 40% while ensuring fault tolerance across multiple clusters.",
  "I also developed secure serverless components in Rust, including custom AWS Lambda runtimes that cut cold start times significantly compared to Node.js implementations. This work taught me how to combine low-level systems knowledge with modern DevOps practices.",
  "Beyond my professional work, I have pursued projects that deepen my expertise in Rust's ecosystem. I built a hybrid chatbot leveraging Rust's FFI to integrate with machine learning models, and I published a case study on applying Retrieval-Augmented Generation to enterprise environments. My open-source portfolio demonstrates my eagerness to experiment with concurrency models, type-safety, and zero-cost abstractions to deliver real-world value.",
  "I am eager to bring my background in Rust, distributed systems, and fleet data optimization to the Fleet Optimization Team at Company GmbH. Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills can contribute to building smarter, more efficient, and scalable backend solutions."
